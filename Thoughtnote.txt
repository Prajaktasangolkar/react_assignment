I made two different one for backend and another for frontend

(1)frontend:
Fistly  I create react app : my-app using command "npx create-react-app my-app  ".

in my-app
- bootstrap is used in public>index.html link of bootstrap is added
- In App.js
  fetchTasks,addTask,handleDelete is used
  

this is add in index.js: <App />

In App.css i have add some styling for example keyframes and media query

(2)Backend:
server.js is file of backend.

firstly I installed required libraries,
    "axios": "^1.6.7",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "node-persist": "^4.0.1"
if the data request is going in same url or not I used postman 

because of storage data will be stored in JSON format in storage file.
here some functions are including
- addTasks
- getTasks
-deleteTask

I used "await storage.clear();" to clear old data on server start
